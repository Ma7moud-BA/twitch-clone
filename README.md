# ngrok (exposing the localhost to the internet)

In development the localhost is not exposed to the internet so we need to expose it to connect it to other services using webhooks
in production this will not be a problem but in development it is,
using ngrok is a way of solving this problem

download ngrok then add the path of the file you installed to the environment variables path, sign up for a free account then add your auth to the config file by running the cli` ngrok config add-authtoken TOKEN [flags]`
then in vscode CLI run `ngrok http 3000`

to get a free static domain in the ngrok website go to `Cloud Edge -> Domains `create a new domain then you will get a cli copy it and paste it in vs CLI but change the port to 3000
` ngrok http --domain=manually-growing-quail.ngrok-free.app 3000`

after these steps the localhost will be exposed to the internet thorough the static domain generated by ngrok, you can find this domain in the `forwarding` label in the cli

so now in development run `npm run dev ` then `ngrok http 3000`

# Clerk Webhook

Clerk webhooks allow you to receive event notifications from Clerk. Clerk will send a POST request to a URL you specify when certain events happen in your Clerk account.

https://clerk.com/docs/users/sync-data

in clerk dashboard go to webhooks, add Endpoint then paste the static domain provided by ngrok`https://manually-growing-quail.ngrok-free.app`then add `/api/webhook/clerk` so `https://manually-growing-quail.ngrok-free.app/api/webhook/clerk`

Then in the message filtering select User created ,deleted , updated events , click create then you will get a signing secret, store this secret in the .env file

Instal svix `npm install svix`
Svix provides a package for verifying the webhook signature, making it easy to verify the authenticity of the webhook events.
Then build the webhook, use the documentation.

add "/api/webhooks/(.\*)" to the public routes in the middleware file

fire a testing event from clerk to test the webhook

modify the webhook to create,update,delete a user model in the db every time an event is done by clerk
